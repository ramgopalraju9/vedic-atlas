"""RememberSkill — save, list and forget lasting facts about the user.

The chat prompt always carries the saved facts (see ResponderAgent), so a preference stated once
("my favourite sweet is gulab jamun") is known in every later session without depending on a
similarity search over old summaries. Facts are keyed by topic: a new value for the same topic
replaces the old one.

Name, description, argument schema and examples come from config/tools/remember.yaml; this class only
holds behaviour. Each result carries a `spoken` sentence, which is the user-facing reply (reply_mode:
template), so the confirmation is always backed by what was really written.
