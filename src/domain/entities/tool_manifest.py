"""ToolManifest — the single declarative source of truth for one model-callable tool.

Everything that used to be scattered (description in the skill class, regexes
in the guard, examples in the prompt, hosts in privacy.yaml) is declared once
here, and the rest of the harness is *generated* from it: the prompt block,
the JSON-schema the model is constrained to, the router's trigger patterns,
the guard's claim/intent rules, and the reply mode.

Pure data — no I/O, no regex compilation. Loaded from config/tools/*.yaml by
a ToolManifestStorePort adapter.
