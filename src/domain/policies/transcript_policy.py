"""TranscriptPolicy — is this "transcript" real speech, or a speech-to-text artefact?

Whisper-family models invent text on noise and near-silence: stock YouTube
phrases ("please subscribe to our channel", "thanks for watching"), a word
repeated dozens of times ("Bye. Bye. Bye. ..."), or a phrase looping until
the length cap. Passed on as a user turn, these make the assistant answer
things nobody said. This policy recognises them so the voice loop can drop
the turn. Pure: no I/O, no model.

It is deliberately conservative about *what counts as an artefact* — only
shapes real speech essentially never has — so a genuine short command is
never discarded.
